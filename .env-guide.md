# Environment Files Guide

- **`.env`**: The baseline configuration. Next.js loads this by default. Usually git-ignored if it contains secrets, but some teams check in defaults here.
- **`.env.example`**: A template file. check this into Git. It lists the _names_ of required variables (like `DATABASE_URL`) but leaves values empty or as placeholders. It tells new developers what they need to set up.
- **`.env.local`**: Local overrides. **Never** check this into Git. This is where you put your real secrets (AWS keys, Stripe keys, local DB URL). Next.js gives this priority over `.env`.

**Why we have them:**

- We need `.env` (or `.env.local`) for Prisma/Next.js to run.
- We need `.env.example` for documentation.
- We added `prisma.config.ts` logic to explicitly load them for the CLI.
